# "Tossup" is the process of choosing one player over another for some
# perquisite (typically, the privilege of making the first move in a game) --
# which is itself a kind of mini-game (and necessarily zero-sum).

# This program implements a trustless, symmetric tossup protocol.
# Trustlessness means that neither player need trust the other to play fairly
# nor a referee to rule impartially.  (In fact, there is no referee at all.)
# Symmetry allows the protocol to be executed by both players following the
# same script (in contrast to asymmetrical protocols like "I flip, you call",
# where two different roles exist and must be assigned somehow).
