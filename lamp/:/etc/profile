# Lamp uses the value in /sys/type/text/DEFAULT as the creator code of text
# files it creates.
#
# `open -t` checks $MAC_EDITOR_SIGNATURE first, and if not defined falls back
# on /sys/type/text/DEFAULT.
#
# You should set a text editor which can handle large files with LF newlines
# (which excludes SimpleText on both counts).
#
# Lamp defaults to BBEdit ('R*ch') for natively-booted classic Mac OS and
# TextWrangler ('!Rch') for Mac OS X, including Classic.

#echo 'R*ch' > /sys/type/text/DEFAULT  # BBEdit
#echo '!Rch' > /sys/type/text/DEFAULT  # TextWrangler
#echo 'CWIE' > /sys/type/text/DEFAULT  # CodeWarrior IDE
