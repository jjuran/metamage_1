Requirements
------------

MacRelix is known to run on Mac OS versions 6.0.8 through 9.2.2 and Mac OS X versions 10.2 through 10.6.  It's possible to run on a machine with only 4 MB of RAM, though more is strongly recommended.

Sockets support currently requires Open Transport.

Some features are incompatible with Carbon and are disabled in Carbon builds.

Metrowerks CodeWarrior is required to build MacRelix.
