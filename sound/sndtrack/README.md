This program plays the sounds that an application running in [Advanced Mac Substitute][AMS] sends to the Sound Driver.

Special thanks to Keith Kaisershot for developing macsnddrvrsynth, on which sndtrack is originally based.  Along with [pipeplayer][] (also by Keith), macsnddrvrsynth made it possible to hear sounds generated by Advanced Mac Substitute for the first time.
