sndtrack
========

This program plays the sounds that an application running in [Advanced Mac Substitute][AMS] sends to the Sound Driver.  Most of the audio synthesis logic has been moved to its own library, [libsndtrack][], while sndtrack itself deals with playing that audio using the PortAudio library.

Special thanks to Keith Kaisershot for developing macsnddrvrsynth, on which sndtrack is originally based.  Along with [pipeplayer][] (also by Keith), macsnddrvrsynth made it possible to hear sounds generated by Advanced Mac Substitute for the first time.
