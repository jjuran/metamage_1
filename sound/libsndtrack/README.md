libsndtrack
===========

This library generates the sounds that an application running in [Advanced Mac Substitute][AMS] sends to the Sound Driver.  This code was originally part of [sndtrack][], which is now a client of libsndtrack.

Special thanks to Keith Kaisershot for developing macsnddrvrsynth, on which libsndtrack (by way of sndtrack) is originally based.  Along with [pipeplayer][] (also by Keith), macsnddrvrsynth made it possible to hear sounds generated by Advanced Mac Substitute for the first time.
