sndtrack-jr
===========

This program plays the sounds that an application running in [Advanced Mac Substitute][AMS] sends to the Sound Driver.  It's like [sndtrack][], but it uses the Sound Manager API instead of PortAudio — so unlike sndtrack, it's 32-bit only, but it works in Mac OS 10.3 "Panther" and 10.2 "Jaguar" (at least), as well as classic Mac OS via [MacRelix][].
